# Matt Steele's dotfiles

Everyone loves dotfiles!

Main stuff this sets up:

* Vim
* zsh
* Git
* Screen
* [.osx](https://mths.be/osx)

## Installing

Requires: Ruby and Rake to be installed

* Clone to `~/dotfiles`
* `cd ~/dotfiles; rake install`

## Usage

Everything stays in the `~/dotfiles` folder; the Rake task creates symlinks into your home directory.
